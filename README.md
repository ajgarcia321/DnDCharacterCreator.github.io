DnD Character Creator
Alfonso Garcia
Unit 1 Project

This project made use of the coding languages HTML, CSS, as well as Javascript including jQuery and ajax. The goal of the project was to find a way to both style and create a website that takes advantages of API's that one could find online. I found a Dungeons and Dragons API (http://www.dnd5eapi.co/) that has a large database of many different monsters, races, classes, and etc. With how large the game truly is I had narrowed it down to a simple way people can explore and get an idea about the kind of characters one can play. My approach started with using methods similar to the "corgi carousel" lab wherein I could display images of both races and classes allowing the user to cycle through them until they found one that seemed interesting. I also used some hints of flexbox in the organization of the page making sure each element had its own div and container. When it came to accessing the API all I needed was the content on each race or class, inputting the images myself. As for responsive design I aimed to use viewport measurements, but it has become apparent that it does not work as well as I had imagined.

My original plan was to have the images disappear and a section of text to appear and take its place providing a description, however this proved more difficult than I had imagined leading my to take a different approach and accomplish a similar objective by instead creating a pop-out box that contained the information that could then be closed. Another difficulty was the API not having specific information I was looking for such as a description of each class and having nested objects become difficult to access and append to my HTML as can be seen by the lack of information in the Class section. In terms of my HTML and CSS, the images I found online were all different sizes with no real way for me to edit them without ruining ratios and sacrificing image quality. Because of this my image containers and images themselves were made carefully and specifically for my browser dimensions causing the mobile view to become very distorted with the some buttons appearing far below and straying away from my original plan to have them lined up in a column.

In order to properly view this site locally one must have the files: app.js, style.css, index.html, as well as the Images folder containing the logos for both races and classes.
